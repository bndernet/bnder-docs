# All Commands

Commands are detected by starting a message with the [prefix](prefix.md). After that, the command has to be typed
correctly, otherwise the bot won't respond to the message. In the examples we will use the default prefix `-` (dash).

:::info

Arguments surrounded by "<" and ">" are custom texts. So you can type in whatever you want. When using it in a command,
the "greater than" and "less than" aren't necessary. Look at the examples for more context.
