# App

Currently, we offer a free Android and Web-App. In the App you can see all [Tasks](tasks.md) assigned to you and your groups categorized by their state.

## Android App
The Android App is available in the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.bnder.team_manager_bot_app).

## Web-App
If you don't want to use the Android App or if you use another Operating System you can use the [Web-App](https://bnder.net/app) wich is identical to the Android App.

## App Login
The login is done by typing in a token. You will get the token by executing the [`token` command](all-commands.md#general-commands).
