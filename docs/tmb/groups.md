# Groups

A group can be created by using the [`group create` command](all-commands.md#group-commands). When a group was created,
you can begin adding users to it using the [`group add` command](all-commands.md#group-commands).

## Use cases

If you want to assign a task to multiple members, just create a group. Every group member can work on the task and push
updates to it. This makes it easier for whole teams to work on multiple tasks.

## Group commands

All board commands can be seen [here](all-commands.md#group-commands).
