# Groups

A group can be created by using the [`group create` command](all-commands.md#group-commands). When a group was created,
you can begin adding users to it using the [`group add` command](all-commands.md#group-commands).

## Use cases

If you have a Team with multiple members, and you want to assign a task to the whole team, just create a new group, add
all members you want to, and now you only have to assign the task to the group instead of all members. Every group member
will see the tasks of the group.

## Group commands

All board commands can be seen [here](all-commands.md#group-commands).
