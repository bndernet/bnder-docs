# Prefix

:::tip

By default the prefix of the bot is `-` (dash).

:::

The bot will check the first char of a message sent by a user. If the message starts with the prefix and the following
characters up to the first space or end of message are a command, the bot will process it.

The Prefix will always be one character long but it can be customized to whatever character you want.
The command to change the prefix is shown [here](all-commands.md#general-commands).
