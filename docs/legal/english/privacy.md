Regulation "DSGVO"), we inform you below about the nature, scope, and purpose of the processing of personal data by our
services. This privacy policy applies to our websites, services (the Discord bots "Task Manager#4550" and "Discord

we refer to Art. 4 DSGVO.

## Types of data, purposes of the processing, and categories of data subjects.

In the following, we inform you about the type, scope, and purpose of the collection, processing, and use of personal
data.

### Types of data we process

1. usage data (access times, websites visited, etc.),
2. your Discord ID (an identification number that lets us identify your Discord account. It is unique across the Discord
   platform).
3. data provided by you through our services (individual tasks, server settings & other data you submit to us through
   our Discord bots).

### Purposes of the processing according to Art. 13 paras. 1 c) DSGVO

1. to optimize our website technically and economically, to enable easy access to the website, to optimize and
   statistically evaluate our services, to support commercial use of the website, to improve user experience, to create
   statistics.
2. your Discord ID is required to bind your data to your account. However, we do not collect any personal data in the
   process. All data is stored together with its ID
3. enable you to make optimal use of our services, customize the services according to your wishes

4. categories of data subjects according to Art. 13 paras. 1 e) DSGVO Visitors/users of the website Discord users who
   share a Discord server with one of our services.

Data subjects are collectively referred to as "users".

## Legal basis for the processing of personal data

### Below we inform you about the legal basis for the processing of personal data:

If we have obtained your consent for the processing of personal data, Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. a) DSGVO is the legal basis.

If the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures,
which are carried out at your request, Art. 6 (1) S. 1 lit. b) DSGVO is the legal basis.

If the processing is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation to which we are subject (e.g. legal retention
obligations), Art. 6 paras. 1 p. 1 lit. c) DSGVO is the legal basis.

If the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person, Art. 6 (1)
S. 1 lit. d) DSGVO is the legal basis.

If the processing is necessary to protect our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party and your
interests or fundamental rights and freedoms are not overridden in this respect, Art. 6 (1) S. 1 lit. f) DSGVO is the
legal basis.

### Disclosure of personal data to third parties and order processors

As a matter of principle, we do not pass on any data to third parties without your consent. If this should nevertheless
be the case, then the disclosure is made based on the legal grounds mentioned above, e.g. in the case of the disclosure
of data to online payment providers for the performance of contracts or due to a court order or because of a legal
obligation to hand over the data for a criminal prosecution, to avert danger or to enforce intellectual property rights.

We also use processors (external service providers, e.g. for web hosting of our websites and databases) to process your
data. If data is passed on to the processors as part of a contract processing agreement, this is always done by Art. 28
DSGVO. In doing so, we carefully select our processors, regularly monitor them, and have been granted a right to issue
instructions regarding the data. Also, the processors must have taken appropriate technical and organizational measures
and comply with the data protection regulations according to BDSG n.F. and DSGVO.

### Data transfer to third countries

The adoption of the European General Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO) has created a uniform basis for data protection
in Europe. Your data is therefore predominantly processed by companies to which DSGVO applies. If, however, the
processing is carried out by services of third parties outside the European Union or the European Economic Area, these
must meet the special requirements of Art. 44 et seq. GDPR. This means that the processing takes place based on special
guarantees, such as the officially recognized determination by the EU Commission of a level of data protection
corresponding to the EU or the observance of officially recognized special contractual obligations, the so-called "
standard contractual clauses". In the case of U.S. companies, submission to the so-called "Privacy Shield", the data
protection agreement between the EU and the U.S., fulfills these requirements.

### Deletion of data and storage period

Unless expressly stated in this data protection declaration, your data will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose
for storing it no longer applies, unless its further storage is necessary for evidence purposes or is contrary to
statutory storage obligations. This includes, for example, retention obligations under commercial law for business
letters by Section 257 (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) (6 years) and retention obligations under tax law for
receipts by Section 147 (1) of the German Fiscal Code (AO) (10 years). If the prescribed retention period expires, your
data will be blocked or deleted, unless the storage is still necessary for the conclusion or fulfillment of a contract.

## Existence of automated decision making

We do not use automated decision making or profiling.

### Provision of our website and creation of log files.

If you only use our website for informational purposes (i.e. no registration and no other transmission of information),
we only collect the personal data that your browser transmits to our server. If you wish to view our website, we collect
the following data: - IP address;

- Internet service provider of the user;
- Date and time of access;
- Browser type;
- Language and browser version;
- Content of the retrieval;
- Time zone;
- Access status/HTTP status code;
- Amount of data;
- Websites from which the request came;
- Operating system.

A storage of these data together with other personal data of you does not take place.

This data serves the purpose of user-friendly, functional, and secure delivery of our website to you with functions and
content as well as their optimization and statistical evaluation.

The legal basis for this is our legitimate interest in data processing, which also lies in the above purposes, according
to Art. 6 para. 1 p.1 lit. f) DSGVO.

For security reasons, we store this data in server log files for a storage period of days. After this period has
expired, they are automatically deleted, unless we need to keep them for evidence purposes in the event of attacks on
the server infrastructure or other legal violations.

### Cookies

We use so-called cookies when you visit our website. Cookies are small text files that your Internet browser places and
stores on your computer. When you call up our website again, these cookies emit information to recognize you
automatically. The information obtained in this way serves the purpose of technically and economically optimizing our
web offers and providing you with easier and more secure access to our website. When you access our website, we will
inform you using a reference to our data protection declaration about the use of cookies for the purposes mentioned
above and how you can object to this or prevent their storage ("opt-out"). Our website uses session cookies, persistent
cookies, and third-party cookies:

- Session cookies: we use so-called cookies to recognize multiple uses of an offer by the same user (e.g. if you have
  logged in to determine your login status). When you visit our site again, these cookies provide information to
  automatically recognize you. The information thus obtained is used to optimize our offers and to provide you with
  easier access to our site. When you close the browser or log out, the session cookies are deleted.
- Persistent cookies: these are automatically deleted after a specified period, which may differ depending on the
  cookie. You can delete the cookies at any time in the security settings of your browser.
- Cookies from third-party providers (third-party cookies): According to your wishes, you can configure your browser
  settings and, for example, refuse to accept third-party cookies or all cookies. However, we would like to point out at
  this point that you may then not be able to use all the functions of this website. Read more about these cookies in
  the respective privacy statements of the third-party providers.

The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. lit. b) DSGVO if the cookies are set to initiate a contract,
e.g. for orders, and otherwise, we have a legitimate interest in the effective functionality of the website, so that in
this case Art. 6 paras. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO is the legal basis.

Objection and "Opt-Out": You can generally prevent cookies from being stored on your hard drive by selecting "do not
accept cookies" in your browser settings. However, this may result in a functional restriction of our offers. You can
object to the use of cookies from third-party providers for advertising purposes via a so-called "opt-out" via this
American website (https://optout.aboutads.info) or this European
website (http://www.youronlinechoices.com/de/praferenzmanagement/).

Contacting us via contact form / e-mail / fax / mail When contacting us via a contact form, fax, mail, or e-mail, your
information will be processed to handle the contact request.

The legal basis for the processing of the data is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a) DSGVO if you have given your consent. The
legal basis for the processing of data transmitted in the course of a contact request or e-mail, letter, or fax is Art.
6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. The responsible party has a legitimate interest in processing and storing the data to be
able to respond to user inquiries, to preserve evidence for liability reasons, and, if necessary, to be able to comply
with its statutory retention obligations for business letters. If the contact aims after a contract, the additional
legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b) DSGVO.

We may store your information and contact request in our customer relationship management system ("CRM system") or a
comparable system.

The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer required to achieve the purpose for which they were collected.
For the personal data from the input mask of the contact form and those sent by e-mail, this is the case when the
respective conversation with you has ended. The conversation is ended when it is clear from the circumstances that the
matter in question has been conclusively clarified. We store inquiries from users who have an account or contract with
us until two years after termination of the contract. In the case of legal archiving obligations, the deletion takes
place after their expiry: end of commercial law (6 years) and tax law (10 years) retention obligation.

You have the option at any time to revoke your consent to the processing of personal data according to Art. 6 (1) p. 1
lit. a) DSGVO. If you contact us by e-mail, you can object to the storage of personal data at any time.

### Google Adsense

We have integrated advertisements of the Google service "Adsense" (Google Ireland Limited, Reg. No.: 368047, Gordon
House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland) on our website. The advertisements are identified by the (i) note "Google ads"
in each ad. In doing so, we have enabled the personalized ads to show you more interesting ads that support the
commercial use of our website, increase the value for us and improve the user experience for you. With the help of
personalized advertising, we can reach users based on their interests and demographic characteristics (e.g., "sports
enthusiasts") through Adsense.

For these purposes, when you visit our website, Google receives the information that you have accessed our website. For
this purpose, Google places a web beacon or cookie on your computer. We do not know the full extent of the data
processing and the storage period. The data is also transferred to the USA and analyzed there. If you are logged in with
a Google account, Adsense can assign the data to your account. If you do not want this, you must log out before visiting
our website.

However, other information may also be used by Google for this purpose:

- The type of websites you visit and the mobile apps installed on your device;
- Cookies in your browser and settings in your Google account;
- Websites and apps you have visited;
- Your activity on other devices;
- Previous interactions with ads or advertising services from Google;
- Your Google Account activity and information.

When an Adsense ad is clicked, the IP of the user is processed by Google (usage data), whereby the processing is
pseudonymized (so-called "advertising ID") by shortening the IP by the last two digits.

In the case of personalized advertising, Google does not link identifiers from cookies or similar technologies with
special categories of personal data according to Art. 9 DSGVO such as ethnic origin, religion, sexual orientation, or
health.

It cannot be ruled out that the above data will be passed on to third parties, authorities, or Google partners. This
website also has Google AdSense third-party ads enabled. The above data may be transferred to these third-party
providers (named at https://support.google.com/dfp_sb/answer/94149).

The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. Google is certified under the
EU-US Privacy Shield: https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework.

You can object to or prevent the installation of cookies by Google Adsense in various ways:

- You can prevent cookies in your browser by selecting the "do not accept cookies" setting, which also includes
  third-party cookies;
- You can deactivate personalized ads on Google directly via the link https://adssettings.google.com, whereby this
  setting only lasts until you delete your cookies. To disable personalized ads on mobile devices, you can find
  instructions here: https://support.google.com/adsense/troubleshooter/1631343;
- You can disable personalized ads from third-party advertisers participating in the "About Ads" advertising
  self-regulatory initiative through the link https://optout.aboutads.info for US sites or EU sites
  at http://www.youronlinechoices.com/de/praferenzmanagement/, and this setting will only last until you delete all your
  cookies;
- You can permanently disable cookies by using a browser plug-in for Chrome, Firefox, or Internet Explorer at the
  link https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996. This deactivation may mean that you can no longer fully use all
  the functions of our website.

In the privacy policy for advertising of Google at https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads, you can find more
information about the use of Google cookies in ads and their advertising technologies, storage period, anonymization,
location data, how it works, and your rights.

### Google Analytics

We have integrated the website analysis tool "Google Analytics" (Google Ireland Limited, Reg. No.: 368047, Gordon House,
Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland) on our website.

When you visit our website, Google places a cookie on your computer to analyze your use of our website. The data
obtained is transferred to the USA and stored there. If personal data should be transferred to the USA, Google's
certification by the Privacy Shield Agreement (https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework) provides a guarantee that
European data protection law is complied with.

We have activated the IP anonymization "anonymizeIP", which means that the IP addresses are only processed in a
shortened form. On this website, your IP address is therefore shortened beforehand by Google within member states of the
European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases
will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator of
this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, compiling reports on website
activity, and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the responsible party. We have
also activated the cross-device analysis of website visitors, which is carried out via a so-called user ID. The IP
address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics is not merged with other data from Google. The use of
Google Analytics serves the purpose of analyzing, optimizing, and improving our website.

The legal basis for this is our legitimate interest in data processing, which also lies in the above purposes, according
to Art. 6 para. 1 p.1 lit. f) DSGVO.

The data sent by us and linked to cookies, user IDs (e.g. user ID), or advertising IDs are automatically deleted after
months. The deletion of data whose retention period has been reached takes place automatically once a month.

You can find more information about data usage at Google Analytics
here: https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html (Analytics Terms of Use)
, https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=de (Analytics Privacy Notice) and Google's privacy
policy https://policies.google.com/privacy.

Objection and "Opt-Out": You can generally prevent cookies from being stored on your hard drive by selecting "do not
accept cookies" in your browser settings. However, this may result in a functional restriction of our offers. You can
also prevent the collection of data generated by the cookie and related to your use of the website to Google and the
processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following
link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de.

As an alternative to the above browser plugin, you can prevent the collection by Google Analytics by
clicking [here](/privacy?gaoptout=1). The click will set an "opt-out" cookie that will prevent the collection of your
data when visiting this website in the future. This cookie is only valid for our website and your current browser and
will only last until you delete your cookies. In that case, you would have to set the cookie again.

You can deactivate the cross-device user analysis in your Google account under "My data > Personal data".

### Presence in social media

We maintain profiles or fan pages in social media to communicate with the users connected and registered there and to
provide information about our products, offers, and services. The US providers are certified under the so-called Privacy
Shield and are thus obliged to comply with European data protection. When you use and call up our profile in the
respective network, the respective data protection information and terms of use of the respective network apply.

We process the data you send us via these networks to communicate with you and to reply to your messages there.

The legal basis for the processing of personal data is our legitimate interest in communicating with users and our
external presentation for advertising by Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. Insofar as you have given the responsible party
of the social network consent to the processing of your data, the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a) and Art. 7
DSGVO.

The data protection notices, information options, and objection options (opt-out) of the respective networks can be
found here:

## Rights of the data subject

### Objection or revocation against the processing of your data.

Insofar as the processing is based on your consent according to Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. a), Art. 7 DSGVO, you have the

When exercising such an objection, we ask you to explain the reasons why we should not process your data as we have
done. In the event of your justified objection, we will examine the merits of the case and either discontinue or adjust
the data processing or show you our compelling legitimate grounds based on which we will continue the processing.

d) DSGVO is met:

- If you contest the accuracy of the personal data concerning you for a period enabling the controller to verify the
  accuracy of the personal data;
- the processing is unlawful and you object to the erasure of the personal data and request instead of the restriction
  of the use of the personal data;
- the controller no longer needs the personal data for the processing, but you need them for the establishment,

- if you have objected to the processing according to Art. 21(1) DSGVO and it is not yet clear whether the controller's
  legitimate grounds override your grounds.

### Right to data portability

### Data security

To protect all personal data transmitted to us and to ensure that data protection regulations are complied with by us,
as well as by our external service providers, we have taken appropriate technical and organizational security measures.
Therefore, among other things, all data between your browser and our server are transmitted encrypted via a secure SSL
connection. Data that is shared personalized by you with our services (for example, tasks through the "Task Manager"
bot) is highly encrypted and protected to the best of our knowledge. We cannot and do not guarantee data security.
