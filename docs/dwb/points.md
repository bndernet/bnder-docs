# Points

The Bot has a small point system, where users can get points for following their own limits.

If a user goes offline before reaching his [limit](all-commands.md), he will get 20 Points. If the bot notifies him and his online time is
less than 10 Minutes above the limit, he will get 10 Points.

The points can be seen in the [ranking command](all-commands.md).
